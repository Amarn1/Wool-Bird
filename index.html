    <br><h1>Welcome to Wool Bird!</h1>
    <p>I created this buisness for the fun and to make other people happy!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</p>
    <img src="Crochethooks.webp">
    <p>I offer whales, stingrays, and octopi that come in yellow, black, green, pink and blue!ðŸ§¶
    <p>Each critter takes me around 30 minutes to an hour to create, the materials also cost me, so I have priced each one at $5, to buy a set of 3, it will cost $12, you can save $3 by buying an octopus, stingray and a whale of the same colour!</p>
    <p>I have created this page for learning about what I can do!
